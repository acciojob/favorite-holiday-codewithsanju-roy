	<p>A "home" is a place of residence, providing shelter and a sense of belonging. It's not just a physical structure, but also a place where individuals feel safe, comfortable, and connected to family, friends, and their own identity. Homes serve various functions,
		including sleeping, eating, working, and leisure activities. </p>
